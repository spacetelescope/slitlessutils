# Slitlessutils


## Quickstart


``
pip install slitlessutils
``

You also need to download the tarfile from https://stsci.app.box.com/s/d7l2frydc58zarfbcq7tkn7gx0qe7o9c and unpack it with `tar -xzvf slitlessutils_config_v0.9.tar.gz`. This will expand the archive into a directory names `slitlessutils_config` - you then need to set the `slitlessutils_config` environment variable to the path of this directory with `export slitlessutils_config=[directory path]`. It will be useful to put this command into your `bash_profile` or equivalent so you don't need to set it every time you start a new session.
