Calibrations for WFSS
=====================

The calibration files for ``slitlessutils`` are staged on a centralized box repository, which can be accessed using the :class:`~slitlessutils.Config()` object.  For more information, please see :doc:`the configuration documentation <configure>`.  



Spectral Specification
----------------------

To extract or simulate WFSS data, we must specify the `Spectral Trace`_  and the `Spectral Dispersion`_, which are each given as parametric curves (as described in `Pirzkal and Ryan 2017 <https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2017/WFC3-2017-01.pdf>`_). In brief, here a parameter: :math:`0 \leq t \leq 1` describes the :math:`(x(t), y(t),\lambda(t))`.  However, these functions can vary within the field-of-view, which is parametrized by the :term:`undispersed position` :math:`(x_0,y_0)`.  


Spectral Trace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :term:`spectral trace` describes the position of the spectrum on the detector(s).  The relative position of the spectral trace is given as a polynomial in the parameter:

.. math::
   \begin{eqnarray}
		\tilde{x}(t;x_0,y_0) &=& a_0(x_0,y_0) + a_1(x_0,y_0)\,t + a_2(x_0,y_0)\,t^2 + \ldots \\
		\tilde{y}(t;x_0,y_0) &=& b_0(x_0,y_0) + b_1(x_0,y_0)\,t + b_2(x_0,y_0)\,t^2 + \ldots
	\end{eqnarray}

However, the spectral element may be rotated with respect to the calibration observations (by an angle :math:`\theta`; the default value is :math:`\theta=0^{\circ}`), and therefore, requires introducing a small rotation matrix.  Now the position in the spectroscopic image will be:

.. math::
	\begin{eqnarray}
		x(t;x_0,y_0,\theta) &=& x_0 + \cos(\theta)\,\tilde{x}(t;x_0,y_0) + \sin(\theta)\,\tilde{y}(t;x_0,y_0) + \Delta x \\
		y(t;x_0,y_0,\theta) &=& y_0 - \sin(\theta)\,\tilde{x}(t;x_0,y_0) + \cos(\theta)\,\tilde{y}(t;x_0,y_0) + \Delta y
	\end{eqnarray}

where :math:`(\Delta x, \Delta y)` are the :term:`wedge offsets`.


Spectral Dispersion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :term:`spectral dispersion` describes the wavelength along the spectral trace.  The spectral dispersion of a :term:`grism` element is often constant with wavelength, which corresponds to a linear (or low-order polynomial) in the parameter:

.. math::
	\lambda(t;x_0,y_0) = \alpha_0(x_0,y_0) + \alpha_1(x_0,y_0)\,t + \alpha_2(x_0,y_0)\,t^2 + \ldots

which will be given by a :class:`~slitlessutils.core.wfss.config.StandardPolynomial`.  However, :term:`prism` elements often exhibit a dispersion that is highly non-linear (as a function of wavelength), which can be described as a `Laurent polynomial <https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LaurentPolynomial.html>`_ (e.g. `Bohlin et al 2000 <https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/acs/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/isr0001.pdf>`_).  However Ryan et al. (2023) extended the normal description into the parametric form to comport with the `more generalized coordinate transformations <https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2017/WFC3-2017-01.pdf>`_:

.. math::
	\lambda(t;x_0,y_0) = \beta_0(x_0,y_0) + \frac{\beta_1(x_0,y_0)}{(t-t^*(x_0,y_0))} + \frac{\beta_2(x_0,y_0)}{(t-t^*(x_0,y_0))^2} + \frac{\beta_3(x_0,y_0)}{(t-t^*(x_0,y_0))^3} + \ldots

This introduces an additional parameter :math:`t^*` that effectively modulates the non-linearity.  This form is implemented in the :class:`~slitlessutils.core.wfss.config.ReciprocalPolynomial()` object.



.. note::
	This formulation of the spectral trace and dispersion differs from what was used by `aXe <https://hstaxe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, which effectively employed the path length along the trace as the parameter.  However, this formulation is more computationally efficient with no loss in accuracy.  



Field-Dependence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As noted above, the coefficients in the trace and dispersion polynomials can be polynomials of the undispersed positions:

.. math::
	\kappa(x_0,y_0) = \kappa_{0,0} + \kappa_{1,0}\,x_0 + \kappa_{0,1}\,y_0 + \kappa_{2,0}\,x_0^2 + \kappa_{1,1}\,x_0\,y_0 + \kappa_{0,2}\,y_0^2 + \ldots

where :math:`\kappa` can be any of the elements of :math:`a, b, \alpha`, :math:`\beta`, or :math:`t^*`. These spatial polynomials are specified by :class:`~slitlessutils.core.wfss.config.SpatialPolynomial` and are of fixed total order :math:`n`.  This implies the number of any set of these coefficients will be a `triangular number <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number>`_ and serialized with `Cantor pairing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function>`_.  


.. note::
	In all above cases, the coefficients :math:`{a}, {b}, {\alpha}` will be unique for each spectral order and must be determined from calibration observations.


Usual Workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since ``slitlessutils`` is largely predicated on forward-modeling the WFSS data, the usual workflow begins with a known direct image position and assumed wavelength, then the WFSS image position is given by:

#. Use the :term:`world-coordinate system` (WCS) to transform from the direct image position to the *undispersed position* in the WFSS image.  
#. Invert the spectral dispersion to find the parameter (:math:`t`).
#. Evaluate the spectral trace with the parameter (:math:`t`).

.. note::
	For linear dispersion models, this inversion can be done analytically.  For higher-order polynomials, ``slitlessutils`` inverts using `Halley's Method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_method>`_.


.. _flatfield:

Flat Field
----------

The flat-field corrects for differences in the pixel-to-pixel sensitivity, and is derived by observing a suitably flat illumination pattern.  Importantly, this correction is wavelength-dependent, but the wavelength covered by a WFSS image pixel will depend on the *undispersed position* :math:`(x_0,y_0)`.  Therefore, the WFSS images are not flat-fielded but the calibration pipelines, and so it must be accounted for in the extraction/simulation processes.  ``Slitlessutils`` implements the wavelength-dependent flat field as a polynomial in wavelength:

.. math::
	F_{x,y}(\lambda) = \sum_{k=0} F_{x,y}\,w(\lambda)^k

where 

.. math::
	w(\lambda) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
	0 & \text{for } \lambda<\lambda_0 \\
	\frac{\lambda-\lambda_0}{\lambda_1-\lambda_0} & \text{for } \lambda_0\leq\lambda\leq\lambda_1 \\
	0 & \text{for } \lambda_1<\lambda\end{array}\right.

and the parameters :math:`\lambda_0, \lambda_1` are the lower and upper bounds (respectively) for which the flat-field cube is defined.  See :numref:`flatfield` below for a schematic layout of this polynomial flat field.  Additionally, users may also specify a *gray flat* (typically derived from a direct image flat field, which is effectively just a single level in :numref:`flatfieldexample`) or a unity flat (effectively ignoring the flat-field correction entirely).  See:

* Unity flat field: :class:`~slitlessutils.core.wfss.config.UnityFlatField()`
* Gray flat field: :class:`~slitlessutils.core.wfss.config.ImageFlatField()`
* Polynomial flat field: :class:`~slitlessutils.core.wfss.config.PolynomialFlatField()`
* factory function to load these: :func:`~slitlessutils.core.wfss.config.load_flatfield()`

.. _sensitivity:

Sensitivity Curves
------------------

The :term:`sensitivity curve` provides the conversion between detector units (usually :math:`e^-/s`) to physical units (usually :math:`erg/s/cm^2/Ã…`), which depends on spectral order by **NOT** on spatial extent as that is addressed by the :ref:`flat-field <flatfield>`. This can be thought of as a wavelength-dependent :term:`zeropoint` in flux units.  :numref:`senscurves` shows the sensitivity curves for several :term:`grism` and :term:`prism` modes for several HST instruments.

.. note::
	Although the sensitivity curves have explicit units, they are adjusted by the :doc:`configurable parameters <configure>`: ``fluxscale`` and ``fluxunits``.
