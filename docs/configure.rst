Configuring ``slitlessutils``
=============================

Many of the functions and classes within ``slitlessutils`` expose their individual default settings, however in some cases it is important to define *global* variables that govern calibration files or large-scale aspects of the package.  Consequently, ``slitlessutils`` establishes these settings in a singleton class :class:`~slitlessutils.config.Config()` that generally acts like a standard Python dictionary.


``Slitlessutils`` Calibration Files
-----------------------------------
The reference files used to perform the spectral extraction and modeling with ``slitlessutils`` must be installed in a dot-directory in the user's home: :file:`{$HOME}/.slitlessutils`.  When the :class:`~slitlessutils.config.Config()` object is instantiated, it will check if this directory exists and valid reference files are populated.  If no such directory is found, then it is created; if no such reference files are found, then the most recent files will be automatically retrieved from a public box directory.  However, users can programmatically retrieve and use older versions of files:

.. code-block:: python

   # load the config module
   from slitlessutils import config
   cfg = config.Config()

   # download the latest reference files
   reffile = cfg.retrieve_reffiles(update=True)

   # download a particular version, but do not use it
   reffile = cfg.retrieve_reffiles(version='1.0.1', update=False)



The :code:`update=True` flag will use these versions for the remainder of this session.  One can list available reference libraries or swap between them:


.. code-block:: python

   # print all config files available
   cfg.help_refmanifest()

   # swap the reference file versions
   cfg.set_reffiles(refversion='1.0.1')

   # show the manifest again, to see the new files were used
   cfg.help_refmanifest()


.. warning::
   Each time that ``slitlessutils`` is imported, it will use the most advanced version of the reference files that are cached in the user's home directory: :file:`{$HOME}/.slitlessutils`


Global Variables (`~slitlessutils.config.Config()`)
---------------------------------------------------
To ensure consistency between several major subcomponents of ``slitlessutils``, global variables are stored in the singleton configuration class.  These variables are:


.. list-table:: Global Variables
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable Name
     - Data Type
     - Purpose
   * - fluxscale
     - ``float``
     - | The numeric scale of the spectral elements.  This is important to
       | avoid numeric underflow errors (in some cases).
   * - fluxunits
     - ``str``
     - The physical units of the spectral elements.
   * - compression
     - ``str``
     - | The type of data compression used in the HDF5 files as implemented
       | by `h5py <https://pypi.org/project/h5py/>`_.
   * - compression_opts
     - ``int``
     - | The compression level used in the HDF5 files as implemented by
       | `h5py <https://pypi.org/project/h5py/>`_.



The default values are set in the file :file:`$HOME/.slitlessutils/<VERSION_NUMBER>/defaults.json`. These versions can be accessed and/or adjusted programmatically as either dictionary-like or attribute-like access and saved to a file for usage later:

.. code-block:: python

   # change value using dict-like access
   cfg['fluxscale'] = 1.

   # change value using attribute-like access
   cfg.fluxunits = 'erg/s/cm**2/micron'

   # save file to a local config
   cfg.write("myconf.json")

.. note::
   One can manually edit the defaults file, however new reference files packages will come with their own `defaults.json` file. Therefore, we recommend programmatically alter the settings to ensure consistency in results if the reference files are updated.
