# Slitlessutils Core


The guiding ethos of the ```slitlessutils``` codebase is that slitless spectroscopy cannot be shoehorned into a slit- (or aperture-) spectroscopic based approach.  Rather, slitless spectroscopy is at the intersection of imaging and spectroscopy, but still not just IFU or so on.  Instead, we must be explicit about the interplay between imaging and spectroscopy, and this drives the choices of representing sources and data in these ways.
